## Dependencies
This project runs on the following dependencies:

-  [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org) and [Express](https://expressjs.com) for the Server
-  [Socket.io](socket.io) for communicating between the client and the server

## Why I made this project
Since my last game project, I've always been wanting to make a online multiplayer game where players can interact with each other, rather than a dull monoplayer game. To do this, I wanted to learn Socket.io as it makes it much simpler to program a live multiplayer game. So, this small project is my attempt at getting started with Socket.io, and I'm planning to continue developing this game by adding more features.
